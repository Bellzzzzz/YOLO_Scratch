# YOLOv3 Object Detection with OpenCV and PyTorch

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook demonstrating object detection using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) with OpenCV and PyTorch. YOLOv3 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm that is fast and accurate.

## Overview

This Colab notebook provides a step-by-step guide to:
- Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights.
- Implement object detection on images and videos using OpenCV and PyTorch.
- Visualize the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

The implementation showcases how to utilize YOLOv3 for detecting objects in real-world scenarios, making it accessible and easy to understand for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

## Features

- **YOLOv3 Architecture**: Implementation of the YOLOv3 architecture using PyTorch.
- **Object Detection**: Code to perform object detection on images and videos.
- **Visualization**: Functions to visualize the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

## Usage

To run the notebook:
1. Click on the following link to open the notebook in Google Colab: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TDTMyOd8BiQff1iF4indZZEOLNFVd99d)
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell sequentially.
3. Upload your own images or videos to test the object detection capabilities of YOLOv3.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Google Colaboratory (if using the provided Colab notebook)

## Example

To perform object detection on an image:

```python
# Run this in the Colab notebook after loading the model and defining functions
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
detect_image(image_path) 

To perform object detection on a video:

# Run this in the Colab notebook after loading the model and defining functions
video_path = 'path/to/your/video.mp4'
detect_video(video_path)
